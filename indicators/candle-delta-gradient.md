# Candle Delta Gradient

![Candle Delta Gradient](../assets/image/candle-delta-gradient-large.png)

## Description

The **Candle Delta Gradient** indicator visualizes the net difference between buying and selling volumes, known as delta, directly on your chart through color gradients. This indicator provides insights into market sentiment and trading activity by coloring each candle based on its delta value.

The indicator offers two calculation modes:
- **Separated for Bullish and Bearish Candles**: Uses distinct color gradients for bullish and bearish candles.
- **Unified**: Applies a single color gradient to all candles.

These modes allow traders to select the approach that best fits their analysis needs.

## Key Features

- **Delta-Based Candle Coloring**: Each candle is colored based on its delta value, providing visual cues about buying and selling pressure.
- **Dual Calculation Modes**:
  - *Separated for Bullish and Bearish Candles*: Differentiates bullish candles with a green gradient and bearish candles with a red gradient.
  - *Unified*: Uses a blue gradient for all candles.
- **Automatic Span Calculation**: Percentile-based thresholds are calculated from historical data, adapting the indicator to various market conditions.
- **Optional Logging**: Allows users to log candle delta values for detailed analysis. This feature is disabled by default.

## How it Works

### Calculation Process:

1. **Data Collection**: The indicator gathers delta values from historical candle data.
2. **Percentile Computation**: It calculates percentiles (10th, 30th, 50th, 70th, and 90th) to establish thresholds for categorizing delta values.
3. **Color Assignment**:
   - **Separated Mode**:
     - **Bullish Candles**: Green gradient, with shades representing different levels of positive delta.
     - **Bearish Candles**: Red gradient, with shades representing different levels of negative delta.
   - **Unified Mode**: Blue gradient for all candles, representing overall market activity.

### Logging Feature:

- When enabled, the indicator logs each candle's delta value, along with whether it is bullish or bearish.

## How to Use

1. **Visualizing Market Sentiment**: Darker shades indicate stronger buying or selling pressure, while lighter shades suggest weaker pressure.
2. **Mode Selection**:
   - **Separated Mode**: Use for detailed analysis where differentiating between buying and selling pressure is important.
   - **Unified Mode**: Use for a simplified view of overall market activity.
3. **Analyzing Market Activity**: Identify periods of increased or decreased activity based on the intensity of the color gradients.
