# Welcome to My Atas.net Financial Indicators
I am not affiliated with, endorsed by, or working in partnership with the ATAS platform. I am an independent user and enthusiast who has developed these indicators for my personal use, based on my own experience and extensive use of the ATAS platform. I will be publishing new indicators regularly, so if you're interested in staying updated, follow me on Twitter and Instagram.

    <h3><a href="./indicators/candle-delta-gradient">Candle Delta Gradient</a></h3>
    <p>The Candle Delta Gradient indicator visualizes the net difference between buying and selling volumes (delta) through color gradients on your chart. I like using this indicator on cumulative trades charts to gain a different perspective on the tape. It provides a clear view of market sentiment and helps identify shifts in trading activity.</p>

    <h3><a href="./indicators/atr-bands">ATR Bands</a></h3>
    <p>The ATR Bands indicator overlays dynamic support and resistance bands on your price chart by leveraging the Average True Range (ATR). I like to use this indicator on cumulative trade charts where itâ€™s not always easy to see the trend. The bands adapt to market volatility, providing a reliable measure for identifying potential breakout or reversal points.</p>

  <div class="description">
    <h3><a href="./indicators/chandelier-exit">Chandelier Exit</a></h3>
    <p>The Chandelier Exit is a trailing stop-loss indicator that I often use in combination with another indicator as a primary or confirmation tool. It adapts to market volatility, helping to capture profits while protecting against sudden reversals. This indicator is particularly useful in trending markets for managing trades effectively.</p>

  <div class="description">
    <h3><a href="./indicators/candle-duration">Candle Duration</a></h3>
    <p>The Candle Duration indicator reintroduces the time dimension into non-time-based charts on the ATAS platform, such as volume, delta, or tick charts. I use this indicator to spot patterns on ATAS volatility or volume charts by observing how long each candle takes to form. This approach provides deeper insights into market activity.</p>

    <h3><a href="./indicators/vidya">Variable Index Dynamic Average (VIDYA)</a></h3>
    <p>The VIDYA indicator is an adaptive moving average that adjusts dynamically to market volatility using the Chande Momentum Oscillator. I often use VIDYA as a baseline in my strategies, combining it with other indicators to identify trend direction. It offers a more responsive and visually intuitive analysis tool with customizable colors for bullish and bearish signals.</p>

It features adjustable parameters and optional directional coloring for easy visualization of market trends.</p>
